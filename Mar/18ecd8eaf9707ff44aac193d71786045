Johannesburg – Ekurhuleni Executive Mayor Mzwandile Masina has hailed strides made by the ANC-led coalition government to improve delivery and governance in the metro in the past five years. “The coalition government, led by the ANC, has proven effective not only in governing the City, but also in remaining an anchor through the most turbulent times in our democratic dispensation,” said Masina in his last State of the City address on Wednesday. To say our coalition government has been efficacious in bringing about change and stability would be an understatement.” Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the City of Ekurhuleni. The establishment of the municipality was the logical conclusion to a protracted struggle by the democratic government to annihilate the vestiges of our apartheid past – a past that continues to find expression in our spatiality. Masina has put the reconstruction of the economy top of his administration’s list. “Our onslaught in this battle must be a solid post Covid-19 Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan anchored on our 10-point plan.” Progress made in implementing the 10-point plan: 1. Revitalization of the manufacturing sector • Investment in OR Tambo International Airport Industrial Development Zone (IDZ).
• Northern Precinct (R1-billion), currently under implementation with over 2 000 people working in the precinct.
• Tambo-Springs Inland Port Special Economic Zone (SEZ) (R20-billion) over 15 years), currently under implementation to deliver the required bulk infrastructure to support the development; and
• The Wadeville Industrial Revitalization Plan in partnership with National Treasury city support programme. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-41233" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="464" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--300x200.jpg 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--768x512.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--696x464.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--630x420.jpg 630w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fab-lab-guys--scaled.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> 2.

Building a robust healthcare system In pursuit of equitable health care, a year before the pandemic hit, the City had nine clinics that rendered 24-hour services. Furthermore, four clinics rendered 12-hour services while 20 offered Saturday services. We also championed modernisation and innovation in our health-care system.
