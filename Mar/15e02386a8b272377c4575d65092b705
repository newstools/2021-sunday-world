Did you insult him as well? Yawn.   • Can somebody please tell me: Is anyone bothered by the Budget speech and do they even believe half of it? Shwa doesn’t.

Gqeberha, which used to be Port Elizabeth, sounds like a furry animal, while Maclear or Nqanqarhu is enough to scare the local village children. Oh, the peanut gallery suggests you call Port Elizabeth, GQ. Many are laughing at the names, which have great significance, and it’s not funny. Someone said they tried to book a flight and the search engine took him to Guatemala. Another claimed he tried to pronounce Port Elizabeth’s new name and his furniture started to levitate. It’s not funny … maybe a little bit. • How does radio personality Nonn Botha stay so hot while her age mates resemble odadobawo? Please teach them.

Shwa thinks she is brilliant.   • Are there any hot celebrities who have not had plastic surgery? Can you post your pics from the 90s?
