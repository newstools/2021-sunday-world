Johannesburg – The sudden emergence and rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic forced Mpumalanga to change its plans as resources were redirected to urgent and pressing issues aimed at curbing the spread of the pandemic. However, Mtshweni-Tsipane told the province’s residents that her administration is focused on getting people back to work and reigniting the economy. Early signs are that the province is headed in the right direction. “We will focus on areas where the province has a competitive advantage, a clearly defined and sustainable economic growth path. Top of our priorities is economic transformation and mass job creation,” said the premier. The province has also committed itself to intensifying the rollout of the Mpumalanga industrial development plan, Nkomazi special economic zone (SEZ)and the Mpumalanga international fresh produce market. Mtshweni-Tsipane said the Nkomazi SEZ and Mpumalanga international fresh produce market have a high potential not only to place the agricultural sector on a growth trajectory, but also to create massive job opportunities and investments.
