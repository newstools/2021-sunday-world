Johannesburg – Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) leader Shepherd Bushiri’s daughter Israella Bushiri has passed on. The eight-year-old had been battling a lung infection and placed in and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at an undisclosed Kenyan medical facility after being referred by Malawian doctors. The self-proclaimed prophet released a statement to announce her daughters passing on Monday morning. Israella made headlines last month when she was denied an early opportunity to travel across boarder for urgent medical attention by the Malawian government – which is assumed her life would have been spared if she had travelled on time. “When I spoke to the Doctor, he highlighted that if she has not been blocked at the airport the first time she needed to travel to Kenya for medical assistance, she wouldn’t have passed on,” said Bushiri in a statement.
