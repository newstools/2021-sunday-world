Johannesburg – Well-known Serge “The International Blesser” Caponge has deserted the murky world of blessers and regrets his sordid past. Caponge has also discarded the nickname and now wants to be called only by his birthnames. “I just want to be called Serge Caponge. I no longer want that nickname, please. It brings back bad memories,” he said. The Congolese national said that during his blesser days he blew wags of lucre on expensive gifts for numerous ladies he was dating. The businessman said his decision to repent was motivated by the respect he has developed for women and the desire to raise his only daughter without exposing her to different women. “I also blew cash on throwing parties for slay queens and paying rent for them. At that time, I felt like I was doing the right thing and wanted to feel the power of my money.   “But I have since realised that what I did was wrong and was akin to disrespecting women …I’m ready to contribute positively to our society without using money in a bad way,” he said.
