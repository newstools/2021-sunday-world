We like private affairs.   Congrats Thuso Mbedu for your role in The Underground Railroad. We are so proud of our dark beauty. Just goes to show that you don’t have to be yellow, just have talent.   Why are people so upset that uMamkhize is set to make an appearance on Uzalo? How does it impact your existence? She was quoted saying she is giving people what they want. We assume she is talking about Andile and the soccer team.
