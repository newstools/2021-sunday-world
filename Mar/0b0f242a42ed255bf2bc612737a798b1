Johannesburg – Political reporter for news channel eNCA Lindsay Dentlinger – currently under investigation for racism for allegedly treating politicians differently when she interviews them – is our moegoe of the week. During her post-budget interviews outside parliament, Dentlinger spoke to FFP leader Pieter Groenewald without a mask, but insisted UDM deputy president Nqabayomzi Kwankwa keeps his on while speaking to her. Commentators have weighed in on the controversy, claiming it’s not the first time the journo has taken black politicians to task for not wearing their masks while turning a blind eye to their white counterparts. Take a look at the reaction to the incident on Twitter below:        Charmza of the week: Miss SA Shudu Musida is our charmza for words of encouragement to disappointed matriculants who did not do well in their exams. Taking to social media, the reigning queen of Mzansi said the tough year for the Class of 2020 compounded by the struggles with the Covid-19 pandemic, made it difficult for many to do well. Our charming Miss SA reminded those who did not achieve their goals in the matric year that the results do not define who they are and should pick up the pieces and move on to other avenues to better themselves. The beauty queen has also launched her mental health initiative MindfulMondays, together with the SA Depression and Anxiety Group.
