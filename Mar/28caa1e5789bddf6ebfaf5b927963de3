They will play their group matches in Casablanca, Morocco’s economic capital and the country’s biggest metropolitan. The team is expected to leave for Morocco on Thursday, 4 March 2021 to continue with their preparations ahead of their opening match on 15 March 2021 against Mali. They will then face current AFCON champions Cameroon on 18 March 2021 and Senegal on 21 March 2021. Head Coach Khumalo said these were exciting times for him and his team and oozed confidence that the team will do the country proud. “We are looking forward to a tough but exciting tournament. We are ready to put up a great show and advertise the South African style of play. In the past South Africa has done very well in the U-17 tournament and we intend to continue doing so,” said Khumalo. “It is unfortunate that there will be no U-17 FIFA World Cup this year as qualification for that tournament was our ultimate goal. However, we will go to Morocco and bring back with us the much needed international experience for these players as they are the stars of tomorrow,” added Khumalo.
