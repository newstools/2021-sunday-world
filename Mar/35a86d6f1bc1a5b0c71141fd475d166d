Johannesburg – Gauteng’s Class of 2020 showed great tenacity to achieve a stellar set of results despite the toughest of circumstances. The results also showed the closing gap between well-funded urban schools and township schools. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi attributed the province’s success to the commitment by pupils, teachers and the department’s officials who were adamant that the 2020 academic year was concluded despite the disruptions of Covid-19. “Expectations at schools across the province have remained at the highest levels, whatever restrictions our students and teachers have faced, and students have absolutely risen to that challenge. We are proud of their excellent results and the opportunities that now await them,” said Lesufi.
