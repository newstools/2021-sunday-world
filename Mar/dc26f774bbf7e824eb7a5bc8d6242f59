Johannesburg – The premier said each provincial department shall continue to ring-fence 2% of its total budget for maintenance of existing infrastructure. “The issue of dilapidating infrastructure will continue to receive attention in the upcoming financial year.

This programme supports, among others: • The paving of township and rural roads;
• Short-term employment in the education sector such as teacher assistants, screeners and general workers; and
• The employment of social workers. Currently, several projects are being implemented in the following municipalities: Bushbuckridge, Chief Albert Luthuli, Dr JS Moroka, Thembisile Hani and Nkomazi local municipalities. Going forward, the premier said that Infrastructure South Africa will be responsible for project preparation, packaging, funding pathways and providing strategic oversight over all the gazetted projects that will be funded through the National Infrastructure Fund. “These projects will create opportunities for support of local manufacturing and development of township economies. “What is critical to note is that not all the proposed infrastructure projects will need new funding, therefore, there is no need to develop other new grand plans,” she added. Mpumalanga has also completed 21 water infrastructure projects benefiting 45 470 households to the value of R592-million.
