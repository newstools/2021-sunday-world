Johannesburg – Wayde van Niekerk delivered in style on Tuesday, rocketing to victory in the men’s 200m race at the ASA Athletix Invitational powered by AVANTI at Ruimsig Athletics Stadium in Roodepoort, Johannesburg. Van Niekerk crossed the line in 20.10 (albeit with a +2.1m/s tailwind), holding off a challenge from national 100m record holder Akani Simbine, who took second place in 20.29 in wet and windy conditions. Tsebo Matsoso (SA) finished third stopping the clock at 20.48. “This definitely gave me confidence I didn’t have before,” said Van Niekerk, the 400m world record holder, who clocked a season’s best. “It’s one thing training well, but it’s a different thing executing it against such a quality line-up, guys I have the world of respect for.” Though he was edged out by his close friend and rival, Simbine was also pleased with his result. “I just ran a terrible bend, but other than that I’m happy with the race,” said Simbine, who had won the 100m race in the first leg at Ruimsig the week before. Gold medallist at the 2017 World U18 Championships and the 2018 World U20 Championships, Sokwakhana Zazini flaunted his form when winning the men’s 400m hurdles in 50.13, while Wenda Nel held off a fight from Taylon Bieldt to take the women’s 400m hurdles race in 56.16. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-43620" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="462" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel-768x510.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel-696x462.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel-1068x709.jpg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel-633x420.jpg 633w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wenda-Nel.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> Teenager Renier de Villiers secured victory in the men’s 800m race in 1:46.83, Namibian junior athlete Beatrice Masilingi won the women’s 200m sprint in 22.59 (+3.9) and Charona Bakker of the Netherlands coasted home in 13.46 in the women’s 100m hurdles.

We are encouraged to have witnessed that some of the athletes are at an advanced level of preparation. We are extremely happy with the success of this event, our first since a lockdown was declared by the national government a year ago.” Kyle Whitehill, CEO of Avanti Communications said: “Congratulations to all the athletes on some terrific performances. It’s been an honour to support the ASA Athletix Invitational Meet as competitive athletics finally returned to South Africa. We’ve really enjoyed being part of these two historic meets.” Have you read: DJ Zinhle gushes over her new lover Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
