Johannesburg – Shwashwi has some questions for those that are in the public eye that needs some answers. How is Katlego Maboe? We told you the boys’ club would have him employed in no time. Did we lie?   We will only write about beautiful people like Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe who is a successful business guru and inspiration to all.   Andile Mpisane, they allege your mother bought you a football club at which you are chairperson and a player – the most ridiculous thing we have ever heard, unless you are that good. Is it true?   Can somebody tell us what happened to Zodwa Wabantu’s fragrance as Mother’s Day is around the corner. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7252" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="392" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu-696x392.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu-747x420.jpg 747w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zodwa-Wabantu.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> On the topic of Durbanites, are Mampintsha and Babes still together or is it for the image and attention as these things are common in Egolihood?   We are so proud when we see our veterans not discarded and still contributing to the arts like John Kani and Sipho Hotstix Mabuse. Who did I leave out?     Skhumba is still seen as the best comedian by social media users and he is not arrogant and unapproachable. Can you teach them? It’s a job not a calling.   Can folk leave Khanyi and Kelly alone if they want to bleach as it’s society that makes them want to change their looks. But is it society or marketing? Before:   After:   Can the masses tell us who is pretty, Mihlahli or Ntsiki Mazwai? Mazwai seems to fantasise that she is. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29101" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/P19-ntsiki-mazwai-1.jpg" alt="" width="886" height="498" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/P19-ntsiki-mazwai-1.jpg 886w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/P19-ntsiki-mazwai-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/P19-ntsiki-mazwai-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/P19-ntsiki-mazwai-1-696x391.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/P19-ntsiki-mazwai-1-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /> Can Gail and Kabelo Mabalane tell us why they suddenly resemble each other? Must be the eight year marriage mark.   What does Bujy Bikwa do these days?   Did the Eastern Cape health MEC Sindiswa Gomba think she would survive unscathed?
