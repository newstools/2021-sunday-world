Johannesburg – Social media influencer and socialite Kefilwe Mabote and tender tycoon Edwin Sodi have called it quits. The pair ended its two-year relationship in December, much to the shock of those close to them. Sunday World can reveal that the content creator even took away her personal belongings from Sodi’s multi-million mansion in Bryanston, northern Joburg. The split has been confirmed by close friends of the former couple, including a businessman whom Mabote confided in about her relationship challenges with the Limpopo- born businessman. Mabote and Sodi have been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons lately. Last November, Mabote lost her R1-million lawsuit against Sunday World for referring to her as a slay queen.

Sunday World has also established through some of Mabote’s friends in business that the social media influencer had been complaining that her brand has taken a knock after her relationship was exposed publicly amid Sodi’s troubles with the Hawks. Mabote posted a message on her Facebook account on Friday celebrating being single. The post reads in part: “Good evening to my fellow Singletons … Being single? A beautiful journey! Had to rediscover myself – wants, dislikes and non-negotiable. “And one thing about me? I’m nosediving back into work after ending my mourning period…” In another message Mabote said she was single as a dollar and didn’t need any change. Speaking through her lawyer Mamelo Thulare, Mabote said she had no comment. Sodi couldn’t be reached for comment.
