Johannesburg – Telkom announced new features added to its innovative and popular Mo’Nice proposition. Mo’Nice is a platform that customers may access via the USSD code, *123# to get tailor-made discounted voice and data offers on their mobile plans. The company has reflected on customer feedback in order to improve the product and to this end, more categories and customer segments have been added to the platform to drive even more customised value. Also notable is the addition of the “Recommended 4 U” feature that allows customers to access Freed@ – Telkom’s zero-rated rewards platform; Telkom Pay – Telkom’s digital wallet service and Telkom Plus products. “Our customers have seen great value in these offers and continue to enjoy customised and discounted data and voice offers since launch in 2018. These enhanced features and competitive prices will keep them connected as many of them are still working, learning and entertaining from home .” said Gugu Mthembu, Chief Marketing Officer at Telkom. “Mo’Nice offers are based on an individual’s usage and spending patterns; and for this reason, are designed to be more affordable for that specific customer. Naturally then, the offers will differ every time and from customer to customer. It is this level of customization that ensures that customers will extract the most value instead of a standardised offering.” What’s more, Telkom has introduced additional ways to access Mo’Nice such as WhatsApp (081 160 1700), the Freed@ platform and the Telkom Prepaid app. Customers can expect location-based offers in the near future.
