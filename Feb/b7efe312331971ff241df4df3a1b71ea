Johannesburg – Only released 12 weeks ago, the video for Mi Casa’s single “Mamela” hailed as the ultimate 2020 wedding song for its depiction of a perfect love story has reached over 2.8 million views on you tube. The single received great reviews and support from all the media platforms. Upon the release of the visual instalment, “Mamela” reached even greater heights within the SA Media and beyond. Written about the simple need to take a vacation with the woman he loves, J’Something hits all the right notes and heart strings with what has been cited as one of their best tracks from their new album ‘We Made It’.  Originally known as one of the country’s leading House acts, the band has spread its wings sonically and incorporated fresh sounds and production value, whilst still managing to maintain that hit-making, feel-good Mi Casa vibe that has made them one of our most beloved bands.
