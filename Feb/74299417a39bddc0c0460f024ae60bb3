Johannesburg – A trio of ministers leaves the nation questioning how safe it is given the shenanigans that are being described by a key witness at the Zondo Commission. This week the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture heard that one of the state’s most important agency ensuring the safety and security of South Africans and South Africa’s interests within and outside its borders was headed by different ministers at different times during former president Jacob Zuma’s presidency, whose main mandate was to advance the interests of Msholozi. Former state security ministers Siyabonga Cwele, David Mahlobo and Bongani Bongo were accused of using the State Security Agency as Zuma’s personal campaign, PR and funding agency. Charmza Today’s hero is honoured posthumously. Shonisani Lethole used his last hours on Earth to ensure that no other patient suffered what he had experienced at Tembisa Provincial Tertiary Hospital last June. Lethole, who died on June 29 as a result of Covid-19, sent a message to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Twitter bemoaning the horrendous treatment he was given and the fact that he had not eaten in two days.
