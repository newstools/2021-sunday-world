The systemic trend of learner achievement of which this cohort has been a part of over the last 12 years was an upward trajectory. In 2009, the National Senior Certificate pass rate was 60% and 109 000 learners qualified for Bachelor admissions. In 2020, 76.2% of learners who wrote the National Senior Certificate examination passed and 210 820 of them achieved admission to Bachelor Studies. Over the last 10 years, the pass rate has remained consistently over 70% since reaching this benchmark in 2011. Internal analyses by the Department of Basic Education on the 2020 cohort indicated that the Grade 11 and Grade 10 results were higher than their counterparts of the 2019 cohort. The predictive analysis pointed to a continued upward trend in 2020. But we did not expect the system to be faced with a devastating pandemic that engrossed education systems, teaching and learning, parents and learners across the world into crisis. This unfortunately impacted on the performance of the Class of 2020,” said Motshekga. She also thanked the teachers who fought the good fight and those who sadly succumbed to Covid-19, a pandemic which severely disrupted the education sector. “The achievement of the Class of 2020 should be acknowledged with due respect to the fallen heroes of education sector. In the past year, the sad loss of teachers and officials who succumbed to the pandemic has robbed learners, families, the education sector and society of a multitude of individual talents, skills, dedication, and commitment that served generations of South African children from early learning to adolescence. The contribution of these “soldiers of learning”, many of whom invested into the achievements of the Class of 2020 will be forever remembered.
