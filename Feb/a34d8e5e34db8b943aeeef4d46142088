Johannesburg – The case against DJs Fresh and Euphonik have been dropped after the two released a statement via their social media accounts, stating that the chief prosecutor would not be going ahead with the case. The statement from the pair read as follows: “We are pleased to state that, after considering all of the evidence collected while investigating the claim made by Ms Madikizela against us, the Chief Prosecutor has dismissed the allegations on the basis that the allegations are without merit.
The docket has been marked NOLLE PROSEQUI. As we’ve said before, these are false allegations and we are deeply saddened that GBV, a serious crisis in South Africa, was weaponised in this manner. A huge thank you to all of our family, friends, supporters and to our legal team.” Just last week, the two DJs were fired by Radio 702 and 947 owners Prime Media due to the allegations that they faced. The media company announced the decision last Wednesday evening, indicating that it opted to release the two popular DJs from their contracts.
