Johannesburg – President Cyril Ramaphosa says he is pleased with the start of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, which started in Khayelitsha in the Western Cape, today. “To demonstrate our confidence in this vaccine and help allay any fears that people may have, the Minister of Health and I will join the first health care workers to receive the vaccine in Khayelitsha,” he said ahead of the programme. President Ramaphosa and Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, witnessed the first health care workers receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The vaccine, which has been approved by the South African Health Products Authority, arrived at the OR Tambo International Airport in Gauteng on Tuesday night. The first batch of 80 000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is being prepared for distribution across South Africa with immediate effect.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been shown in extensive trials to be safe and efficacious, and will protect health care workers from illness and death from COVID-19. “We have called on leaders in various sectors and parts of the country to lead by example and get inoculated publicly. We will therefore witness some Premiers, MECs and leaders from civil society, religious formations and traditional leadership being being vaccinated in all provinces. “We have chosen vaccination and we call on all South Africans to choose vaccination and protect one another,” the President said.
