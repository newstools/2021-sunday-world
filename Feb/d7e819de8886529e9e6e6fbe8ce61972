Johannesburg – The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) says recipients of the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant need not reapply for the grant. This follows the announcement made by President Cyril Ramaphosa during the State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday, that the special COVID-19 grant of R350 would be extended for another three months. The special grant was introduced last year following the emergence of Coronavirus. According to SASSA, the agency has processed in excess of 9.6 million applications each month from May 2020 to January 2021, and has paid more than 6.5 million grants per month. “The total amount spent on this grant to date has exceeded R16 billion,” SASSA said in a statement on Friday. The following should be noted about this grant: SASSA has also reassured all citizens who had their special grant approved, but had not been paid by the end of January, will still be paid through the existing payment channels, including the South African Post Office, direct deposits into bank accounts or money transfers to cell phones, as requested by the approved applicants. – SAnews.gov.za Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
