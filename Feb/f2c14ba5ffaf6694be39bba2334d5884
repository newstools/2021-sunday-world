Johannesburg – Orlando Pirates earned maximum points as they outfoxed and outplayed Cape Town City, beating the visiting Citizens 2-0 at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday evening. Goals by Namibian midfielder Deon Hotto in the first minute and a second strike by Vincent Pule were enough to seal the DStv Premiership game for the Soweto giants.  Bloemfontein Celtic also secured a hard-fought for victory over SuperSport United after beating Matsatsantsa a Pitori 2-1 at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium in Mangaung on Tuesday afternoon.
