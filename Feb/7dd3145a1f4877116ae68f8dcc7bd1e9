Johannesburg – Talking about the #Over- 40challenge, how old is Somizi? He swears like he is still in his early 20s. He must not confuse his age with that of Mohale. • Black Twitter should drag Romeo and Basetsana Kumalo to the challenge. The two look like what dreams are made of. And the fact that they have been married for so long should serve as an inspiration to Lebo M. • Well done Pearl Thusi on your latest film. They may say you can’t act but the directors clearly disagree. When are you coming home, hun? DJ Zinhle seems to miss you.   • Can Jacob Zuma just do the right thing as the drama is getting a tad stale? • When will Floyd marry Lorna? We just love weddings and free cake.   • Whatever happened to Noni Gasa and is she gone?   • It was interesting to see analysts dissecting the meeting between Baba and Juju as if the agenda was put out. What happened to keeping one’s mouth shut when one does not have enough facts?   •Is Edwin Sodi alive and well? Married celebrities are safe, for now.
