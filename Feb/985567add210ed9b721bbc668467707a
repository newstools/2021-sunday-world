By Bongani Mdakane Johannesburg – A crisis is looming at universities as students are up in arms over their future. This comes after it emerged that thousands of students at top universities in the country are facing financial exclusion due to lack of funding. Sunday World has learnt that due to financial woes caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, many students who relied on student loans and family members are at their wits’ end due to job losses. “At Wits University, there are 8 124 students who are at risk of financial exclusion,” said Wits University SRC president Mpendulo Mfeka.

Ishmael Mnisi, the spokesperson for the Department of Higher Education, said: “Students who are currently funded by NSFAS, who continue to meet funding and study eligibility requirements, will continue being funded.” “NSFAS is of the view that enough time was given to students to apply for 2021 funding. Students who missed this window are encouraged to apply for financial assistance in the next cycle,” said Sibongile Mncwabe, the NSFAS chief corporate services officer. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-24313" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-696x1044.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-280x420.jpg 280w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /> Click here to sign up to receive your Matric 2020 results.
