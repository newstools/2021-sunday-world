Johannesburg – The officials of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, popularly known as the Hawks, are moegoes for acting unlawfully and with malice when they arrested former finance minister Malusi Gigaba’s wife. When arresting Norma Mngoma for damage to property last year, the moegoes confiscated her phones and laptops. The high court in Pretoria has found that the Hawks were motivated by abuse of power by Mngoma’s estranged husband Gigaba. The judge ruled that the Hawks should return her devices and restore all her information. The Hawks were also ordered to pay her legal costs for challenging the arrest.
