Johannesburg – Starting university is probably the most exciting phase of an education journey. It is a whole new world full of endless possibilities – but … the transition can be daunting as your new home away from home is bound to test your financial resolve. The best way to avoid financial stress on top of the pressure of your studies is to have your money management figured out well before you even open a book, says Neil Thompson, Head of Product and Customer Value Proposition at African Bank. There are many banking options for students, he says, but the main thing is whether the bank account ticks all the boxes for you and what value-adds the account offers. “Even if you’ve never opened a bank account or done transactional banking, banking today isn’t rocket science. Reputable banks understand their customers lead busy lives and need convenience. They understand the needs of students as well as they do those of professionals and have developed products tailor-made for various life stages,” says Thompson. He points out, however, there is an innate culture of sharing in families and this aspect of South African life was largely overlooked by the banking sector. “Families are already sharing many things to make life easier, like property, transport and even their money by putting it into savings initiatives like stokvels. So, why not share banking?” Thompson asks.

It’s the ideal way to provide your child with a means to do proper banking and at the same time loosen the apron strings and allow them financial independence. “The biggest bonus is that not only does the account attract the highest interest rates and lowest bank charges but MyWORLD card holders get rewarded for swiping. You can redeem grocery, prepaid electricity or mobile data vouchers. These are just some essentials which can make life away from home for a student that much easier.” Thompson explains how MyWORLD works. Rates you need to compare:  Students will also be happy to see it is free to top up Prepaid airtime and electricity. It is not only the independence the account offers students (your own separate account number, debit card and PIN and you can bank from anywhere at any time – your bed, the beach, your seat in a lecture hall) but the financial freedom the MyWORLD account offers too, Thompson adds. “However, remember that when the money is gone from your own account it will be because you chose to spend it. This may be a good wake-up call and lesson in budgeting. There can be money for partying and entertainment if you work well with the money and optimise the benefits the MyWORLD account offers Pocket Users.” Click here to sign up to receive your Matric 2020 results. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-24313" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-696x1044.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-280x420.jpg 280w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /> Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
