Johannesburg – The National Treasury announced on Wednesday that the gross tax revenue for 2020/21 is expected to be R213.2 billion lower than projections in the 2020 Budget. “However, due to a recovery in consumption and wages in recent months, and mining sector tax receipts, 2020/21 revenue collections are expected to be R99.6 billion higher than estimated in the 2020 MTBPS. “As a result, government will not introduce measures to increase tax revenue in this Budget, and previously announced increases amounting to R40 billion over the next four years will be withdrawn.” The main tax proposals include an above-inflation increase in personal income tax brackets and rebates, and an 8 percent increase in alcohol and tobacco excise duties.

Funds that could be spent on economic and social priorities are being redirected to pay local and overseas bondholders. “Over the next three years, annual debt-service payments exceed government spending on most functions, including health, economic services, and peace and security.” You may also be interested in: Budget2021: Relief for households as Treasury revises tax brackets – SAnews.gov.za Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
