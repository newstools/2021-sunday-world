Johannesburg – All eyes are on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s state of the nation address, amid the country’s floundering vaccine rollout strategy and the economic hardships visited on families and business by the global pandemic. ANC alliance partners Cosatu and the SACP have called on Ramaphosa to reintroduce the unemployment grant, relief for businesses and consumers, and to provide a detailed plan for the rollout of the vaccines when he delivers the state of the nation address on Thursday. The trade union federation also warned that the president should reaffirm the government’s commitment to collective bargaining by honouring wage increase agreements, saying failure to do so could lead to labour instability.
