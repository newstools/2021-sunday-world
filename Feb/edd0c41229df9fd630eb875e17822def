Johannesburg – Former president Jacob Zuma has dared the might of the state and said he would rather be arrested than give evidence to the state capture inquiry. Zuma in a statement intimated that the judiciary was biased against him, following a ruling by the Constitutional Court that he should appear before the state capture inquiry and answer questions put to him. The erstwhile head of state said he would not appear before Zondo, opening a door for a possible arrest. “I am again prepared to go to prison to defend the Constitutional rights that I personally fought for and to serve whatever sentence that this democratically elected government deems appropriate as part of the special and different laws for Zuma agenda,” reads the statement.

Zuma has stubbornly refused to appear before the Commission, where he has been implicated by more than 30 witnesses in the state capture project. The highest court in the land ruled that Zuma did not have the right to remain silent in proceedings before the commission, potentially ending a long standoff between the erstwhile president and the Commission probing state capture.
