Johannesburg – Over twenty years ago, a young Pan Africanist embarked on a journey of entrepreneurship and empowerment, designed to change the way that South African’s expressed themselves through hair. Having a strong agenda of celebrating the African identity, physically and mentally, the iconic self-named Jabu Stone Natural Hair Care brand was born. Stone, a revered businessman and mentor in the country and continent at large, has continued in the spirit of innovation and empowerment, by developing a mobile phone application, designed specifically for entrepreneurs. Introducing Afrobiz Afrobiz was developed by the leading natural hair care brand to solve basic business issues that new and sometimes seasoned business owners may face. His over two-decade tenure in the hair industry and as a business pioneer as a whole, Stone realized that there was a dire need for a convenient tool to see where money was going in and out of the business. This, alongside other bread, and butter issues enabling entrepreneurs to measure growth- something most owners don’t focus on enough. The app is designed as a tool for anyone looking to scale up their salon and keep track of receipts and automate expense management. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-23465" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jabu-Stone-2-484x1024.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="1024" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jabu-Stone-2-484x1024.jpg 484w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jabu-Stone-2-142x300.jpg 142w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jabu-Stone-2-199x420.jpg 199w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jabu-Stone-2.jpg 605w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /> Some of the key features include: “There are many things one learns in the world of entrepreneurship, but a universal rule is the rule of systems.
