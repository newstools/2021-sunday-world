In January this year, the department of education said that several provinces have completed the marking of Grade 12 exam papers ahead of schedule, and that results will be released on time. Remarking “Learners who are not happy with the marks that they’ve received and feel could have done better than what was rewarded are free to appeal,” the department’s Assessment and Examination Director, Priscilla Ogunbanjo explained. She said once the results are out, candidates can start applying to tertiary institutions until 10 March. The Director said the capacity of the system has been stretched, but she believes it will deliver. The department’s Director-General, Mathanzima Mweli, said there have been a few concerns during the marking process that were immediately addressed. Sunday World will publish the matric 2020 results here at 6am on Tuesday morning, 23 February 2020. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-24313" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-696x1044.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-280x420.jpg 280w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /> Click here to sign up to receive your Matric 2020 results.
