The 2020 NSC overall pass rate, with the progressed learners included, stands at 76.2% – a decline of 5.1% from the record pass of 81.3% achieved by the Class of 2019. “This represents a record of 440 702 passes – an increase of 7.5% in the number of passes from 2019. Without the progressed learners, the overall pass rate stands at 81.2% – a 1.1% decline from 2019.” Motshekga lauded the high quality passes achieved this year, particularly the number of Bachelor and Diploma passes, the overall pass mark, and the passes with distinctions, even in critical subjects. COVID-19 impact “We are of the strong view that, had it not been for the novel COVID-19 pandemic, the Class of 2020 could have been the best performers, since the inception of the National Senior Certificate. We are indeed proud of the Class of 2020, which persevered against such monumental challenges that our system was never exposed to in the past.” The Minister said those who sat for the exams characterised the resilience of the system, “which withstood an unprecedented test of administering an examination of the largest number of candidates; faced by the worst pandemic in human history”. Motshekga said the 2020 academic year will be remembered as the year that, not only presented major health challenges, but a year when the entire world was engulfed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Government with its education departments and its strategic partners, worked very hard to strike a balance between saving lives and the 2020 academic year. The matric exams, which concluded on 15 December 2020, saw 147 question papers being set. – SAnews.gov.za Click here to get your Matric 2020 results.
