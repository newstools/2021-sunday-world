By Tumi Sole Johannesburg – In June 2015, I was involved in a car accident and was subsequently assaulted by the occupants of the other car. My laptop, cellphone and other belongings were also stolen. I was unable to cope for a while due to the trauma. I struggled to sleep for following this ordeal. It was not until I saw a therapist at work and she recommended I attempt something different to try to cope. That is how I have took to running and I never looked back. January 2020, like any other New Year, saw people start with their New Year’s resolutions and these included fitness goals and the likes. Around January 5 2020, I tweeted that I would be running and taking charge of my life. I then encouraged my followers to join using #RunningWithTumi- Sole. Unbeknown to me, there was overwhelming support and people started sharing their runs and fitness goals using the hashtag. To date, the #RunningWithTumi- Sole has reached over 156-million users on Twi¡er and continues to trend, and abo mgijimi (runners) keep encouraging each other. #Running- WithTumiSole has a strong presence in Mzansi and is represented in all the nine provinces. It is amazing what the movement has achieved thus far in just over a year of existence. It has now become a safe space for runners and walkers to share their stories. There have been numerous instances where some runners have shared how #RunningWithTumi- Sole has helped them cope with daily life challenges. Two personal shares have thus far touched me, and I have shared these on my social media pages. One relates to a female runner who DM’d (direct messaged) me and told me how I have created a safe space for her through #RunningWith- TumiSole as she is a recovering alcoholic and relies on running as a coping mechanism. Another s hare w as f rom a gentleman who would at times run at least 25km daily without fail. I reached out to him on DM and congratulated him on his commitment. He then shared that he was dealing with depression and sought assistance. Through my other work via #CountryDuty, I was able to recommend a psychologist and the gentleman is now running with ease although still doing long distances. #RunningWithTumiSole keeps growing and I have great plans ahead for abo mgijimi. I am currently at advanced stages of having an app for the runners and also working with designers for clothing apparel. Feed your mind, body and soul with some self-care that can only be found on the run. Running can be the calm in the storm. • Sole is a corporate attorney, social activist and influencer. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-24313" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-696x1044.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12-280x420.jpg 280w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Posters-14-Feb-12.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /> Click here to sign up to receive your Matric 2020 results.
