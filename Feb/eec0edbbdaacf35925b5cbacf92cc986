With the technology adding to the existing robust marking processes that GDE have in place. The project was closely scrutinized by both DBE and Umalusi, to ensure that no student was disadvantaged during the pilot and live marking stages of the exam. One of the most exciting benefits of the GDE on-screen marking system is the instantaneous access to rich data. The analytical moderators were able to access real-time data showing how marking is progressing, but also how students have responded to particular questions. The company runs and prints for exam facilities for the Free State and Gauteng Provincial education departments as well as the North West University. Lebone also runs a learner teacher support centre for printing textbooks. Three years ago, Lebone acquired a label printing company now called Lebone Paarl labels which supplies labels to the beverages industry. In total, the company runs seven sites and employs 312 people directly and a further 500 through its suppliers.
