Johannesburg – The football world’s Super Sunday showpiece pits England against Italy in the Uefa’s Euro 2020 final at Wembley in London this evening at 8pm. The English will be out to redeem themselves after a 55- year international trophy drought. They last won the World Cup in 1966. Four-time world champions Italy, who last won the Euro in 1968, are four-time Euro finalists. They go into this final equally hungry to lift the trophy as much as the English. It will be up to Three Lions striker Raheem Sterling, a man familiar with Wembley as he grew up a stone’s throw from the stadium, to bring in his African roots brilliance to the match. Despite losing his starting place at City last season, Sterling has been a key player in this tournament, with his speed, dribbling ability and three goals to his credit. Sterling will be carrying the English hopes of winning the elusive trophy. Gary Lineker is England’s joint-top scorer in major tournaments with 10 goals in World Cups and Euro During this Euro he continued banging important goals that made him Premier League-leading marksman for the third time in 2020/21 season. With their solid defence, the Azzurri of Italy will have to content with the might and rampaging English forwards in Kane and Sterling, and that is where the likes of defenders Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini will be called to distinguish themselves. Bonucci belongs to the era of Christian Vieri, Andrea Pirlo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.   His partnership with Giorgio Chiellini is deadly. However, it is Jorginho’s Brazilian football brains in the Italians’ midfield that could win it for the Azzurri. Italy are currently on a 33-match unbeaten run, and if they do manage to extend this run for another game, the European Championship will head to Italy. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-87993" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P24-Euro-2020-trophy-800x445.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="387" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P24-Euro-2020-trophy-800x445.jpg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P24-Euro-2020-trophy-250x139.jpg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P24-Euro-2020-trophy-768x427.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P24-Euro-2020-trophy-696x387.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P24-Euro-2020-trophy-755x420.jpg 755w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P24-Euro-2020-trophy.jpg 886w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
