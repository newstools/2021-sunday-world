Johannesburg – It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we announce the passing away of Vincent Chulayo, a member of the Safa referee’s review committee and a former assistant referee on the national panel. Chulayo succumbed to the Covid-19 pandemic that has recently claimed the lives of so many people. He spent 13 years on the national panel as an assistant referee and officiated with the likes of late Ian McCloud, Jerome Damon, Walter Mochubela, Des Goslett, Enock Molefe and many more top-ranking match officials. He was currently serving as a captain in the South African Police service. He leaves behind his wife and two daughters. Recently, we also lost another refereeing colleague in Lazarus Matshuisa to the Covid-19 pandemic, who was also a former assistant referee on the national panel. The referee’s department, on behalf of the chairperson of the national referees committee, Anastasia Tsichlas, wish to express our sincerest condolences to both families during this time of mourning. We hope they find comfort and peace over time. -Safa.net Also read: DA to charge Zuma children and Malema for inciting violence on social media Watch: Dramatic scenes as a baby is thrown from burning building Watch: Zuma’s children show support for their dad and criticises Ramaphosa leadership SA falls into a state of lawlessness as protests and looting continues 72 die, 1 234 arrested in KZN, Gauteng lootings Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
