Johannesburg – Award-winning Jazz musician, Tsepo Tshola, has passed away. As South Africa still finds itself under siege, the music industry has been hit by another huge loss. Sunday World can confirm that the legendary singer and producer, Tsepo Tshola, has died. Tshepo, popularly known as ‘The village pop’ exited this earth this morning after complaining about chest pains. Tshola’s family members said that he succumbed to a Covid-19 related illness this morning at Tiyatiyaneng Hospital in Lesotho. He would have turned 68 in a month’s time. Further details about his death remain unclear at this stage. Tshola came into prominence when a group he co-founded and co-led with the late Frank Leepa, Sankomota, came to South Africa in the early 80s and broke all kinds of records, becoming the first Southern African group to visit South Africa and receive the same reception like overseas superstars. Tsola and Leepa subsequently moved to South Africa where Tshola had a highly successful music career selling a number of platinum records. Among his most successful songs were Papa, dedicated to his father and Ho Lokile, dedicated to his late wife Monis Tshola. His debut album, “A New Dawn” received great critical acclaim and showcases the album as a statement of humbleness. Born in Lesotho, Tshepo grew up in a musical family with both his parents involved in choirs. Tshola has been in the industry for more than 40 years, ever since he joined teen boy band The Lesotho Blue Diamonds as a vocalist in 1970. He then went on to join The Anti-Antics and later Uhuru.
