Johannesburg – Obviously home is a bore, so off we went in the middle of winter, braving the cold to Altitude Beach Club for the launch of their new menu and retractable roof. The sparkling swimming pools whispered to us to jump in, but we went straight for the heaters and found a very sexy radio presenter, Kamo Moth, looking phly in her gym-inspired outfit and coat. She was on a sugar high as she was everywhere.   The renovated venue is stunning and its new roof application is great for partying in all weather conditions – and party we did. Mostly we ate, yes, I’m sure I saw Kamo dancing with a drum-stick. Another sexy one was reality star and singer Busiswa Gqulu, who arrived looking hot in a unitard and pink coat. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-80946" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/P21-busiswa-gqulu-800x534.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="465" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/P21-busiswa-gqulu-800x534.jpg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/P21-busiswa-gqulu-250x167.jpg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/P21-busiswa-gqulu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/P21-busiswa-gqulu-696x464.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/P21-busiswa-gqulu-630x420.jpg 630w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/P21-busiswa-gqulu.jpg 886w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> We chatted about some Xhosa guy called Banzi, who gave her the most unprofessional treatment in the Eastern Cape, but we got over it as soon as we saw the ribs. Their new menu is a modern fusion of Asian and Caribbean with an African twist, and we dug in as if there was no tomorrow.   DJ Naves was looking oriental in the corner with the ever-friendly Sugarsmax, who is the nicest in the industry. Comedian Nina Hastie had us in stiches, but I was perving at Christopher Jaftha, who unfortunately was not perving back, but with a snow-white-looking lady and hunky TV presenter Quinton, who is always weary of Shwashwi. Don’t worry, hun, I’m a vegetarian. Beautiful people, an awesome band, loads of heaters, and a slightly tipsy Phil Mphela in velvet made it a fun night.
