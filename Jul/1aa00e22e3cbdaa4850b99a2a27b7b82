Johannesburg – We know the harsh winter winds and sun are harsh and cause havoc on our skin, so instead of looking ashy we asked local beauty house, Afri-Berry for some winter tips to protect your entire family’s skin. Hidden areas such as elbows and knees need special care during winter, to keep them smooth use a product like Jamaican Black Castor Oil(R82.99) which will provide a barrier for locking moisture in the skin especially during the colder months. Use the oil to also promote thicker lashes and eyebrows by brushing it on clean brows. Repeat the process every night before bed and see the results in 6 weeks. Revive dry and patchy skin by using a product which restores the skin’s natural moisture balance. If you have acne or pimple problems why not apply the Moroccan Gold Argan Oil(R99.99) and mix with coffee beans and vanilla extract to create an exfoliating mask. Simply mix all three in one, use one teaspoon of Vanilla extract, three spoons of coffee beans and two spoons of the Moroccan Gold Argan oil and apply on the skin by scrubbing with your finger. For cold winter nights before bed time directly apply the Organic Raw Mango Shea Butter(R72.99) on your face and body to lock in the moisture and keep skin well nourished. Apply the butter to your chapped lips too because the drying effects of winter winds will leave them unappealing. The butter is free from petroleum, chemicals and parabens and suitable for you and baby because it diminishes blemishes, treats eczema while preventing itchy and tight skin There you have it, there is no reason to be ashy this winter, lather and moisturise and don’t forget the exposed areas like hands, face need more protection during winter months. The products are available from selected retail stores and pharmacies. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-83827" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-800x800.jpeg" alt="" width="696" height="696" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-250x250.jpeg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-696x696.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-1068x1068.jpeg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29-420x420.jpeg 420w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.39.29.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-83828" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-800x800.jpeg" alt="" width="696" height="696" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-250x250.jpeg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-696x696.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-1068x1068.jpeg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57-420x420.jpeg 420w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.57.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-83829" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-800x800.jpeg" alt="" width="696" height="696" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-250x250.jpeg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-768x767.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-696x695.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-1068x1067.jpeg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43-420x420.jpeg 420w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WhatsApp-Image-2021-07-01-at-14.40.43.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> Also read: Zuma says his judgment was not consistent with constitution Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
