Johannesburg – As South Africa continues to burn as a result from the massive looting and violent protests across Gauteng and Kwa-Zulu Natal, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has said it will lay charges against Jacob Zuma’s children and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julias Malema. The DA will lay criminal charges against Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, Edward Zuma, Duduzane Zuma and EFF leader Julius Malema for incitement of violence. Over the past week, following the arrest of former President Jacob Zuma, his daughter Duduzile took to social media to post a number of tweets that encourage and incite the violence and looting that has destabilised KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng and which is spreading to other parts of the country. View some of her tweets below: <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-88562" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-1-664x800.jpeg" alt="" width="664" height="800" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-1-664x800.jpeg 664w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-1-208x250.jpeg 208w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-1-768x925.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-1-696x838.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-1-349x420.jpeg 349w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-1.jpeg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-88563" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-3-713x800.jpeg" alt="" width="696" height="781" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-3-713x800.jpeg 713w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-3-223x250.jpeg 223w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-3-768x862.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-3-696x781.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-3-374x420.jpeg 374w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-Sombudla-tweet-1-3.jpeg 912w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> These tweets follow utterances by Edward Zuma that law enforcement agencies would have to go through him before they arrest his father. These comments were both inflammatory and reckless. There is also a video making the rounds on social media in which Duduzane Zuma wows to “fight” to get his father out of prison. Watch the video below:  “For his part, Julius Malema threatened to join the anarchy on the streets if the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is deployed and likened the deployment to a declaration war against civilians instead of an attempt to maintain law and order. We are also deeply disturbed by Malema’s racially charged remarks about the Indian community that have the potential to incite further racial tensions,” the DA said in a statement. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88561" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Twitter-EFF.jpg" alt="" width="754" height="435" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Twitter-EFF.jpg 754w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Twitter-EFF-250x144.jpg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Twitter-EFF-696x402.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Twitter-EFF-728x420.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /> Twitter banned Malema’s account following his tweets and had his account reactivated on Wednesday morning.
