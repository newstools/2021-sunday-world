Johannesburg – I wish most politicians were as brave as our former president Jacob Zuma and his plus one Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina. Do you know how many slay queens and kings will be left homeless if Zuma were to sing? Y’all should be grateful. • It is not a secret, everyone knows that Shwashwi is fond of Juju and his stubbornness, but what I want to find out is: Julius Malema, are you happy or sad now that you got what you fought for? Zuma will be going to jail.   • Floyd Shivambu, we are told the original Mrs Shivambu is not interested in signing divorce papers; have them both wena. Lala, you can also add Shwashwi as your third one, and I come lobola-free. To those who have never met Floyd in person, he is hot; TV does not do him justice. • Has Paul Mashatile ever met Bonang Matheba? Oh, and Terry Pheto? Just asking.
