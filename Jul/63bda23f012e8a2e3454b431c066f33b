Johannesburg – The hair debate on whether to wig or to weave has been on-going for years. We spoke to stylist Thomas Tshoela about the advantages and disadvantages of both having a wig or weave, to make an informed decision on what to purchase. Always remember to use your options and that Black people have been wearing wigs for centuries to protect their hair. Wig VS Weave: Advantages of a wig: • One of the great advantages of having a wig is that it completely covers your head and scalp. For people experiencing thinning, balding or complete hair loss, this a great choice.
• Wigs come in a variety of styles, lengths and colours.
• Human hair and synthetic wigs can be styled to any look you desire. If you’re worried about possible heat damage, look no further than Darling’s Empress collection – which has a human hair feel and can be re-stylable.
• The maintenance of a wig is relatively non expensive. Darling offers a detangler spray in their Empress curls styles to help you keep those curl intact.
• Wigs can be put on and taken off from the comfort of your home. Whether you choose to wear your wig daily or not, there’s a variety of methods for securing your wig, giving you peace of mind that it won’t slip. Disadvantages of Wigs: • If a wig is not secure. It can slip if not properly fitted in. Advantages of Weaves: • Once a weave is sewn in, it can last up to six weeks at most with proper care.
• If a weave is sewn in well, you have peace of mind that the weave won’t move or slip.
• You can treat a weave like it is your own hair with weekly washes and scalp treatment to avoid any build-up. Disadvantages of Weaves: • If your hair is braided too tightly, this can be very uncomfortable and can cause headaches. If your cornrows are braided too tightly this will add scalp tension. Improper application (like braiding hair too tight) can lead to hair loss.
• The weave and your braided hair will need washing weekly or every other week to overcome any build-up of dirt or oil. Which one is best for you? Darling Head Stylists, Thomas Tsheola advises, “The decision on whether to choose a wig or a weave depends on your preferences and hair condition. Weaves and hair extensions give similar results when it comes to length, volume, longevity, and realistic look.’ I have 20 wigs, but do you.
