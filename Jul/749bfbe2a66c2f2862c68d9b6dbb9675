Johannesburg – The KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has left the nation divided after a video of him assaulting a looter went viral. The incident was captured on live TV by a Newzroom Africa crew. The incident left many on social media divided, with some calling for the premier to be arrested or to step down from office, while some, have praised him for fighting back. In a statement, the Premier apologised unequivocally about the incident. “The Premier regrets the level of force used in apprehending a looter, who was attempting to make off with goods that had been stolen from a nearby warehouse. While the action of apprehending a looter is justified, the manner in which this was done is deeply regretted,” the office of the premier said in a statement. “The Premier apologises for this incident. The Premier believes that public violence has no place in society and in the same spirit those who commit acts of destruction do not share in the values of our nation. Once again, we call upon all the people of KwaZulu-Natal to stand united in our diversity and begin our rebuilding programme,” the statement further read.
