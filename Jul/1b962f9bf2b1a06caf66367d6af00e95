Johannesburg – The ongoing looting in KwaZulu-Natal has pitted racial groupings against each other with some affluent suburbs turned into alleged no-go areas for black Africans who are accused of being the masterminds behind the chaos. About 15 people have reportedly been killed in Durban and surrounding areas following the emergence of vigilante groupings armed to the teeth and have organized themselves along racial lines. “Black folks who have not participated in any looting are under siege. The white guys and Indian businesspeople are blocking anyone from accessing shops in their areas. Black people have been killed. We can’t go on like this,” explained Zanele Ndlovu, a resident of Redhill in Durban. Myron Naidoo of the #Defend Phoenix from looters said they had to defend their neighborhood against being plundered. “The limited shops we have are for our community and this has nothing to do with race. We must defend ourselves otherwise we will run short of critical food supplies. This has nothing to do with race,” said Naidoo. The escalating situation has led to AmaZulu king in waiting, MisuZulu kaZwelithini, to intervene and calling for peace, saying more people will become victims if the hostile relations between Whites, Indians, and Blacks were not addressed. Other white suburbs in Durban, according to reports, have also blocked black people from accessing their areas. There have also been circulating social media messages encouraging the alienation of black communities from white and Indian businesses. Contrary to the reports seen on social media, however, former DA leader in KZN, Zwakele Mncwango, posted the following video which has went viral on social media, stating that the reports of blacks being attacked in Phoenix, was simply, not true.
