Johannesburg – A Pretoria child molester has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for raping a nine-year-old child in Tshwane. Duncan Ndlali, 50, was found guilty and convicted of rape when he appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court today. Tshwane NPA spokesperson Lumka Mahanjana said in February 2019 around 7h00 Ndlali went to his girlfriend’s grandfather’s place in Nellmapius in Tshwane. She said his girlfriend and the mother of the child were out of town attending a funeral elsewhere. “When he got there, he found the child in the kitchen, making herself food while the grandfather was sleeping in his room. Ndlali took the child to the other room, placed her on top of the bed, undressed her and began to molest her. The child fought him off and started crying and he stopped,” she said. She added that when the child’s mother returned home later that day, she told her what had happened and the mother reported the matter to the police and Ndlali was arrested. She said Ndlali, who has been in custody since his arrest, pleaded not guilty to the charge of rape. The National Prosecuting Authority welcomed the sentence.
