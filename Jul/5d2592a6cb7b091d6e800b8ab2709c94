Johannesburg – South Africa, it seems, has been left as a nation divided, following the incarceration of the former president, Jacob Zuma. Since Zuma handed himself over to authorities and began serving his 15 month-long prison sentence, Kwa-Zulu Natal was brought to its knees on Friday as protestors took to the streets in the province, demanding that Zuma be set free. The former president was dealt another blow on Friday after the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed Zuma’s application. The court dismissed Zuma’s stay of the warrant of execution for his arrest. Judge Mnguni dismissed the application with costs. Many South Africans and political parties were left divided over the decision to keep Zuma behind bars, with some rejoicing and some offering support to Zuma. In the mix, were some of Mzansi’s stars, who took to social media to show their support for Zuma. Take a look at some of the local celebrities who posted on the Zuma debate: AKA  Gugu Gumede L’vovo  Brenda Mtambo Have you read: Pearl Thusi dragged on Twitter after calling out ANC Also read: Joburg High Court upholds ANC’s suspension of Ace Magashule Carl Niehaus released from police custody Government appalled after Zuma prison pictures leaked Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
