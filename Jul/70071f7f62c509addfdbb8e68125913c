Johannesburg – The South African Football Association (Safa) is mourning the passing away of Banyana Banyana long-serving kit manager, Aletta Ngidi, who succumbed to Covid-19 complications on Tuesday morning, July 13. Aletta has been unwell for the past weeks and passed away on Tuesday. ‘’We have lost a dedicated servant of the game,’’ said Safa CEO Tebogo Motlanthe. ‘’This is painful news. Aletta was supposed to be part of the delegation of Banyana Banyana that was scheduled to travel to the Netherlands two weeks ago for a friendly match in Zwolle. ‘’That trip was called off after a number of players and officials tested positive. We are devastated as the Association and we send our heartfelt condolences to her family, colleagues and friends. May her soul rest in peace.’’ Banyana Banyana coach Desire Ellis said she was gutted following the passing away of Aletta Ngidi. ‘’Aletta was not just a colleague but a family member. There were no dull moments in her presence. She led the singing both in the bus and dressing room and there was always lots of vibe when she was around. This is a massive loss,’’ said a sobbing Ellis.
