Johannesburg – A Mpumalanga spaza shop operator was sentenced to life imprisonment for raping an 11-year-old minor. Nasir Mahamud (39) from Bangladesh, was found guilty and convicted of rape by the Piet Retief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. Mpumalanga NPA spokesperson Monica Nyuswa said Mahamudraped the 11 year old on 23 December 2018. She said Mahamud was running a spaza shop in Amsterdam when he lured the victim to his rental room under the pretext that he wanted to show her something. “Once they got inside, he pinned her down on the bed and raped her,” she said.
A certain lady ,she added, noticed the victim exiting Mahamud’s place and enquired from her what she was doing alone with an adult man. The victim informed her that Mahamud had plundered her. She said members of the community were notified and Mahamud was apprehended and handed over to the local police. When questioned, he denied that he had sexual intercourse with the victim but admitted touching her. He said the victim seduced him. State prosecutor Advocate Marlin Cairncross presented DNA evidence which proved that the victim was sexually violated by Mahamud. “The court found no compelling and substantial factors which justified a lesser sentence other than life imprisonment. The NPA welcomes the sentence,” she said.
