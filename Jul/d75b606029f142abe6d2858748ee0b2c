Johannesburg – South African women continue to make admirable strides in all kinds of businesses. Their enterprises create much-needed jobs for many others. In fact, research shows that women’s participation in entrepreneurship on the continent is rising. Remarkably, women continue to make strides in business despite many systemic hurdles, including a lack of capital, a lack of supportive networks that could pump resources into their enterprises, an environment that doubts their capabilities, as well as customary expectations.
