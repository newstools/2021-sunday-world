Johannesburg – The violent protests and looting that have engulfed South Africa has escalated to alarming levels. Yesterday, the City Life Pearl Towers in the corner of Anton Lembede (previously known as Smith Street) and Joe Slovo (previously known as Field Street) was set alight, with people trapped inside. This resulted in people trying to escape the flames, with a mother left with no other option but to throw her baby to spectators below.
