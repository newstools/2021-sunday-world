Johannesburg – Following Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation on Monday evening, it seems his words had fallen on deaf ears, as parts of Kwa-Zulu Natal and Gauteng witnessed looting and violent protests. Many South Africans in parts of these provinces, listened to gunshots being fired in the distance as some shop owners and security companies tried to defend their belongings from crowds of looters. The economy continued to struggle as well as many shops and medical facilities remained closed in most parts of the two provinces. Ministers in the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) Cluster today tried to reassure South Africans that they are doing all that they can to put an end to the violence and looting. SANDF members have been deployed to some parts of Johannesburg while looting continued in parts of KZN. Ministers in the cluster have over the past two days met to discuss the reports received from the Joint Operations Committee (JOCOM) of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and State Security. These reports included critical intelligence information from the State Security Agency (SSA), South African Police Crime and Defence Intelligence. The intelligence information has provided timeous, critical and sometimes unique analysis information to give early warning signs of potential risks and dangers. “The law enforcement officers have used this intelligence information in responding with speed to the issues on the ground and attending to areas which have been identified as potential hotpot areas,” said Police Minister Bheki Cele, speaking on behalf of the cluster. He said Ministers were satisfied with the reports they had received and were confident that law enforcement agencies were able to do their job effectively. He said of grave concern was the loss of lives that has accompanied the incidents of violence and destruction to property. Ten people have been killed in the two provinces.
