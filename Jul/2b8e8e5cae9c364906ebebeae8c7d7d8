Johannesburg – Eskom is appealing to all citizens to continue using electricity sparingly. This comes as the South African Weather Service issued a warning on Sunday about wet, windy and cold conditions that are expected in some parts of the country this week due to a cold front. The country’s meteorological service said strong winds are anticipated on Monday across the Cape provinces and may result in property damage in some areas, following the arrival of a strong cold front. According to Eskom, it has not implemented load shedding since 13 June 2021 due to some improvement in the performance of the generation fleet and a system that is currently performing relatively well. “However, the cold front will increase the demand for electricity, thereby putting pressure on the power system. Therefore, Eskom urges the people of South Africa to help reduce electricity usage in order to ease pressure on the system.” Eskom said it would communicate promptly should there be any significant changes to the performance of the system. – SAnews.gov.za Also read: Kwesta dealt financial blow as EP is blocked due to Ayanda Jiya’s dispute with producer Ayanda Ncwane quits Real Housewives of Durban Open Mic Productions backs up Master KG claims over Jerusalema royalty claims Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
