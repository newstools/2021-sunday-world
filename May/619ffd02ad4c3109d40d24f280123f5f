Johannesburg – Still no news about the BMW that was registered in your name? What if it was involved in a heist? • What eventually happened to the gold chain the Guptas gave your son? • Who else paid for your honeymoon? • How cold was Waterkloof Air Force Base, I’ve never been there, but I imagine those hangers are huge and cold. • Did you lighten your skin? • Please tell us where else Malusi Gigaba bought clothes from, as we are writing a tell-all book. Will you? • Are you worried about your safety as we know you are a strong one? • What exactly cost so much at your wedding? The bridesmaids? • Who did your make-up? I love the bronze look. I think it stays longer in jail.
