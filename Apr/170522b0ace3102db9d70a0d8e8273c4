Johannesburg – We all know that one young person who inspires us with their vision, dedication and hard work. This is a hero who runs an inspirational project or a forward-thinking company that makes people’s lives a little easier in their cities, towns and villages of South Africa. This is a resilient young person who prefer doing rather than talking. They see opportunity where others see gloom. They are leaders in their fields, leaders of tomorrow. But this young hero remains unsung and their work is largely unknown. Sunday World is giving you a chance to honour these visionary young leaders. We are looking for UNSUNG HEROES under the age of 35 who are pioneers in their fields. Heroes who are admired by their peers and rivals alike. Do you have somebody you admire and you strongly feel is an UNSUNG HERO in business, science, agriculture, arts, sports, culture, health, or the academic world? Or somebody who works tirelessly at grassroots level to improve the lives of others? Simply click here and fill out the form to nominate your Unsung Hero.
