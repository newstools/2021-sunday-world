Johannesburg – It’s been an amazing few months with South Africans making us proud overseas. This week, we celebrate Emmy nominee Loyisa Gola, a comedian, producer and writer whose Comedy Special and one-man show premiered on Netflix earlier in the week. I chatted to the lanky one while he sported Joseph-inspired trousers and what seemed like size 16 Nike sneakers. Q: Are you funnier because you are super tall? A: No, height really makes no diff erence, I’m just funny. Q: Are you opening doors for younger comedians? A: I’m definitely keen to help, and want to help more, but most want exposure when they should be working on their craft . So it depends. Q: Do you feel any pressure to act rich A: I live in Braamfontein and am not about that life. I keep things simple, says the talented one, who insists that he customises his life to his needs Q:What are you doing for Easter? A: I will return to the Cape and my mother will cook the usual delicious pickled fish, like every year. Q: Are you the highest- paid local comedian, because we read Dave Chappelle from the US was reportedly paid $20-million (R301-million)? A: I prefer not to answer that question. Q: On the topic of Cape Town, do you tell jokes about your friends and family members, humiliating them to the world? A: No, I don’t disrespect my family and friend, as I feel it’s bullying them. I have a bigger audience. But I did ask my mom for permission. I joke about her. Q: Who is your favourite comedian locally? A: It has to be between Skhumba and Celeste Ntuli Q: Why is the show called #unlearning? A: I want people to self-evaluate. He might like pickled fish like the rest of us, but he is definitely making major moves. Congrats Loyiso, and try our fish recipe.
