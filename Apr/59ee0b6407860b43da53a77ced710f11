Johannesburg – The teachers and principal of Mbilwi Secondary School in Limpopo are moegoes for turning a blind eye to bullying meted out on pupil Lufuno Mavhungu by a fellow pupil. The incident led to Lufuno allegedly taking her own life. Now we hear that the Limpopo department of education is probing what should have been the duty of the moegoe teachers to investigate after they were informed about the incident. They chose to sweep the matter under the carpet. Lufuno would have been alive today if the teachers and the principal took the matter seriously. This is dereliction of duty of the worst scenario on the part of the teachers and principal. Moegoes!
