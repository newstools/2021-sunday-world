Johannesburg – With 100 days to go before the Tokyo Olympics kick off, South Africa’s under-23 national team coach David Notoane has whittled down his squad to 40. It is from this 40, that he will select his final 22 players to take to the Tokyo Olympics in Japan. This year’s Olympics, which were postponed last year, will run from 23 July 2021 – 8 August 2021. On the selected 40-man squad, Notoane said this was a continuous process until he gets his best 22 that he will take to Tokyo. ‘’I will continue to assess the players until we have the final 22,’’ said Notoane. ‘’The aim is to continue the performance assessment of the selected players based on continuity and need to strengthen the team for the final selection.’’ The u23s will continue with their preparations that commenced in earnest in November 2020 by playing two friendly matches against Saudi Arabia. The team recently completed another successful preparation camp with only local players last month which ran from 21-27 March 2021. During the eThekwini camp, Notoane expressed his satisfaction with what the team was able to achieve despite the absence of overseas-based players. The overseas players could not be part of the camp due to travel restrictions amid the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. South Africa will be joined by Egypt and Ivory Coast as the three African representatives at the Tokyo Olympics. The official draw for the Olympics will be held in Tokyo on 21 April 2021.
