Johannesburg – The ongoing cultural identity and battle for AmaHlubi to be recognised as an independent clan is gaining momentum, with the indigenous cultural grouping releasing its own isi-Hlubi version of the Bible. According to IsiHlubi language board chairperson, Bukhosibakhe Makhetha, the Bible is part of their concerted effort to ensure that isiHlubi language does not go extinct. “This is a breakthrough for us in pursuit for the right to exist as an independent clan. The project summarises the chapters of the key verses in the Bible. The first version will be available to people free. The second project will have a price tag on it,” Makhetha told Sunday World. He added that the project will cater for the religious needs of AmaHlubi as an ongoing work for the battle of their identity, culture and its own kingship. “This project follows after our core work of developing isi- Hlubi language. We are now producing books in our language. We are working closely with higher education institutions and the end goal is to have academic material in isi- Hlubi,” said Makhetha. Key to AmaHlubi’s plan is to have their own king in Kwa- Zulu-Natal with the same status as that of AmaZulu king. The case is currently in court with the cultural grouping also demands, among other things, parts of the land under the Ingonyama Trust whose sole trustee is the AmaZulu king. They also want to revive their IsiHlubi language and push for it to be taught as a language of choice in schools. AmaHlubi court matter emanates from the 2010 Nhlapo Commission in which the clan wanted to be recognised as the second monarch in KwaZulu-Natal, saying their king, Langalibalele I, was stripped of his status as king by the colonial British government because he was considered hostile towards the government of the day. So the clan wanted their kingship restored. But the commission ruled that the claim was illegitimate. Not satisfied with the outcome, AmaHlubi king Langalibalele II took the matter to court seeking that the court overturn the findings of the Nhlapo Commission. The matter is waiting for a court date at the Gauteng High Court. In the application, AmaHlubi are claiming land under the AmaZulu monarch, and they also want to be provided for in the KZN provincial budget.
