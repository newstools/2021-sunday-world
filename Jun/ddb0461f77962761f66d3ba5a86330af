Johannesburg – Umkhosi Womhlanga: Commonly known as the reed dance, Umkhosi Womhlanga is hosted annually in kwaNongoma, northern KwaZulu-Natal and sees more than 50 000 Zulu maidens converge at Enyokeni Royal Palace to celebrate their purity. The ceremony was revived by the late king as a measure to fight the scourge of HIV/Aids and prevent pregnancy among teenage girls by encouraging them to remain virgins. It came under scrutiny recently when the UN declared that it was a harmful practice and that it was discriminatory to other young women who were no longer virgins. Ingonyama Trust The king designate must also grapple with the contentious issue of the land under the Ingonyama Trust, an entity established on the eve of the 1994 democratic elections. The AmaZulu king is the sole trustee of the entity, which controls most of the land in Kwa- Zulu-Natal. The presidential panel, chaired by former president Kgalema Motlanthe, recommended that the Ingonyama Trust Land Act should be scrapped on the basis that it is undemocratic. Bayede Mobile Network The project was conceived with much fanfare by the late Ama- Zulu king who said at the time that ordinary people in the villages will benefit in the network provider by being shareholders. The mobile network was established with the support of JB Holdings investors. It has not made any substantial progress since being launched two years ago.
