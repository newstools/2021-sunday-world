Johannesburg – A flamboyant North West-born entertainer, who started off as a drag queen and now works as DJ at a community radio station, has released an amapiano-meets-gospel single aptly titled Fodisa, meaning “heal us” in seTswana. Mpho Molepolle, popularly known as Mpho Zazah, said his music was born out of his desire to worship God through music, but because he was not vocally gifted, he opted for amapiano. Molepolle from Brits, a born-again Christian at the Kagiso Christian Centre, works at Cosmo City radio station as a DJ. The 32-year-old, who said he has been born-again since the age of 13, wants to give a Christian alternative to mainstream amapiano secular music. He said his music expresses his personal and spiritual beliefs. “My music is about giving praise and worship to God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Most people are going to clubs to escape their daily pain and struggles. I want to fi ll their spirit with music and messages that are uplift ing and positive,” he said. He said he believes in the love of God that reaches out to everyone, straight or gay. “I believe that no matter how you are rejected in life, you are still good enough for God.” Fodisa is an electrifying song and an appetising track for his upcoming album. Molepolle said the song is for “anyone that has ever had the feeling of being completely safe regardless of their spiritual inclination”. “I want to bring Jesus to clubs. Through me, I want people to know that queer people have spiritual needs too. “The church and the Christian music industry have been slower to catch up on queer inclusion.” Molepolle is working on a full album, which he hopes to release early next year.
