Johannesburg – With the partnership formed with the Department of Education (E-learning Department) we created an e-learning platform called eSchool, where grade R – 12 can aces school content as per their curriculum. We have onboarded more than 53 000 learners to our E-School platform. Which will support our Eastern Cape Region in improving on the schools pass rate. Vodacom is an active corporate citizen that has been contributing to societal development including supporting education and supporting the youth person with the necessary needs to enable them to go to school. We partnered up with Exhibition For A Child NPO and did a Walk a child to school campaign. We reached out to our Internal Eastern Region staff members to each donate whatever they could to buy a pair of school shoes for a child in need.   We visited 13 schools and 2 Orphanage homes across our region and namely; Overton Primary School, East London, Kuyga Primary School and Newell High School in Port Elizabeth, Noncampa Primary School in King Williams Town, Siyanda Primary School in Butterworth, Ntaphane SSS in Umtata, Ntsingiza SSS Bizana, St Cuthbert SSS, K.T Mnchasa SSS, Lower Malephelephe Primary School and Dalukhanyo SSS in Tsolo , Clarkebury Agricultural School and lastly Patensie Agriculture School. In total we gifted 335 scholars with a pair of shoes, 100 sets of Toiletries packs, and 2000 Sanitary Towels. This initiative was to support a child in need and providing them with basic necessities so that they can attend school and empower themselves with education.
