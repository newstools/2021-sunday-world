Johannesburg – Gauteng police have confirmed the arrest of three managers of popular restaurants in Sandton and Silverton for selling liquor to patrons, in contravention to the Disaster Management Act and COVID-19 level three lockdown regulations. In a statement, Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said police received information through crime intelligence about a popular restaurant in Sandton, in West Street that was selling alcohol to patrons. “During O Kae Molao Operations on Saturday police pounced on the restaurant and found the place full to capacity and alcohol served openly on the tables and health protocols not adhered to. Two of the managers were arrested and charged with the contravention of the Disaster Management Act. Police also confiscated liquor to the value of approximately R600 000,” said Masondo. Meanwhile, in Silverton in Tshwane police were conducting routine patrols on Friday after the 9pm curfew when they noticed cars parked at a popular franchise restaurant. <img loading="lazy"   alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o.jpg 1024w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-696x522.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-560x420.jpg 560w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-80x60.jpg 80w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-265x198.jpg 265w"  data-src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o.jpg" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19046 lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19046" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o.jpg 1024w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-696x522.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-560x420.jpg 560w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-80x60.jpg 80w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/139983263_4457832447576996_3613310901868720343_o-265x198.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /> On enquiring, police found the restaurant operating and about eleven people drinking alcohol onsite.
