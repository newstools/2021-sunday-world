Johannesburg – The end of an era has seemingly come for South African music lovers, after it was announced that Musica will be shutting down. Clicks South Africa announced that Musica will be closing after many years of decline. According to a statement from the Clicks group, shareholders were advised that the board of directors has taken a decision to close the group’s heritage entertainment brand Musica with effect from 31 May 2021. “Musica has closed 19 stores since the start of the 2021 financial year and is currently trading from 59 outlets. The remaining stores will be closed as leases expire over the next four months when the majority of leases terminate,” the statement read. Acquired by Clicks Group in 1992, Musica has been the country’s leading music and entertainment retail brand for several decades. Musica has been operating in a declining market for several years owing to
the structural shift globally to the digital consumption of music, movies and
games from the traditional physical format. The inevitable demise of the brand has been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic which resulted in the rapid decline in foot traffic in destination malls where Musica stores are typically located. “In the stores which have been closed since September 2020, the Musica staff have been absorbed into the group’s expanding health and beauty store network. Management is committed to accommodating the remaining staff within the group where this is operationally feasible,” Clicks said.
