Johannesburg – Pressure is mounting on authorities to take swift action against Mpumalanga premier, Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane who was seen on TV not wearing a mask in public. The premier was one of the dignitaries attending the funeral of minister in the presidency, Jackson Mthembu, who succumbed to Covid-19. Mtsweni-Tsipane said she was not aware that her mask had fallen, an excuse that has drawn the rebuke of South Africans on social media.

This is why I have spoken to the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, General Khehla Sitole to look into the matter of the Premier and an investigation must be conducted and necessary action must be taken,” Cele said. Many ordinary South Africans have been arrested and fines for not wearing a mask in public spaces.
