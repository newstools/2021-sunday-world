Johannesburg – Can people stop seeking fame then insult fans once they get it. Really, be calm as your fans get you paid and journalists give you exposure. Learn the art of being a celebrity if you are going to insist on being recognised by street walkers. This got us wondering if Bonang Matheba ever received her apology from Itumeleng Khune after she accused him of sexually inappropriate behaviour while he was dating Minnie Jones, who is known to loathe Matheba.

Great that Phumeza Mdabe has a new show on Mzansi Magic, but I hope she realises that the trouble will begin once the cameras leave. Are you ready, sisi? Oh ja, she won’t be there.

Is Lasizwe still throwing himself at Cedric Fourie as it would be amusing if it did not feel uncomfortable to watch?   MaMkhize, what’s next on the cards for you as you are so amusing? A make-up range, because Shwashwi wants to look like you or Somizi.   Oskido, where is Tina Mkwaiwa and did you ever resolve her issue?   Nomzamo Mbatha, we miss you in SA, please come back … we will even find you a man.   We heard some aunty-looking malume was after you, forgetting his yellow-boned wife, as usual. Will the folk who won’t pay rent blaming Covid-19 please stop posting their expensive purchases on social media as the owners are infuriated … names will be released next week.
