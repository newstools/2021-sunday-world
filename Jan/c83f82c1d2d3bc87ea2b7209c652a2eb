Johannesburg – Announced today, the South African Music Week (SAMW), a new annual cross-border collaborative event that in 2021 will take place 26- 28 January 2021. Taking its cue from the world-respected Canadian Music Week, SAMW in 2021, will see South Africa and Canada come together to explore ways in which to maximise how music, technology and business are converging, and to forge a new path for success for all musicians. SAMW is free to attend and will take place virtually in 2021 to take account of ensuing precautions around the COVID-19 pandemic. In a reciprocal exchange, SAMW will aim to build skills and the capacity of the South African Music Industry as a whole, and for artists in both countries to discover new markets for their craft. At the same time, South Africa and Canada are looking to develop a mutually beneficial collaborative investment paradigm to grow the music economy, a by-product of which, could be travel and tourism opportunities between the two. Themed ‘Music in the 4IR’, the 2021 event comprises three days of online panel discussions, a virtual expo, music performances, B2B networking and an industry Hall of Honours event. Founder and CEO of South African Music Week, Michael Moeti, said, “We are excited to write a new chapter for the South African music industry by bringing the world to our doorstep, using the digital age to unearth emerging talent and plugging it into a global audience.  “Thanks to the phenomenal inspiring success of Master KG’s Jerusalema, South African talent is being recognized globally. SAMW is, therefore, the ideal platform from which to entrench this interest and build a robust cross-border music industry based on collaboration and making the most of music in the 4IR.” SAMW is the result of a working visit that Moeti undertook to Canadian Music Week (CMW) in Toronto, Canada in May 2019 where SA was a spotlight at CMW and; a fact-finding mission to Canada in January 2020, which was led by Ms. Mbali Hlophe, MEC for Gauteng Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation. Headed by Canada’s Province of Ontario in partnership with South Africa’s Gauteng Province, among the big names that will participate in SA Music Week are: Lisa MacLeod, Ontario’s Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism, and Culture Industries said, “I’m pleased that we all are coming together to support South African Music Week, in the great province of Ontario. I’m pleased that we continue, as the ‘world in one province,’ to embrace the world over into our music scene and vibrant culture and arts scene. We are there to support you and we cannot wait to see what you deliver next.” Canada will also field a contingent of highly regarded professionals, some of whom have been responsible for the successful careers of some of the biggest global artists including; Drake, Justin Bieber, Celine Dion, The Weeknd and Michael Bublé among others.
