Johannesburg – There are loads of accessible fruit and vegetables packed with vitamins right in your kitchen, so there is no need to rush for supplements. I can’t afford immune boosters and I decided to ask local celebrity Chef Marcus which ingredients I could use at home to boost my immune system during this never-ending Covid-19 pandemic. Hunky and helpful, he made me realise there are loads of accessible fruit and vegetables packed with vitamins right in your kitchen, so there is no need to rush for supplements and deplete funds. • Ginger   Now this made me happy because I have ginger in my fridge. Chef says he includes ginger in hot water when he feels fluish. “Not only is it great to soothe sore throats, it’s full of vitamin B6, helping to build a strong immune system.” • Baby spinach   “It’s full of vitamin A,C and E that you need to boost your system and a great addition to salads,’’ adds the chef while I grimaced because I loathe spinach. Now I will have to love it as it is accessible and good for me.  • Red bell peppers
