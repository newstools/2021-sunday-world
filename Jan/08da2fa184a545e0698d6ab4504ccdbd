Johannesburg – The world of entertainment was sent into a meltdown on Wednesday after various media reports that Kim Kardashian-West was set to end her marriage to rapper superstar Kanye West. Multiple sources told Page Six that “divorce is imminent” for the Hollywood couple, with Kardashian hiring divorce attorney to the stars, Laura Wasser. Wasser, the divorce attorney, represented Kardashian during her 2011 divorce from Kris Humphries and has also represented other stars such as  Angelina Jolie and Heidi Klum. Page Six further reported that Kim, 40, has not been seen wearing her wedding ring, and Kanye, 43, remained at his $14 million Wyoming ranch over the holidays instead of spending it with the Kardashian family.  “Kim got Kanye to go up there [Wyoming] so they could live separate lives and quietly get things sorted out to separate and divorce. She’s done,” Page Six’s said.  Kim and Kanye were married in 2014. They have four children: daughter North, 7, son Saint, 5, daughter Chicago, who turns 3 next week, and son Psalm, 19 months. This is the third marriage for Kim, while it is Kanye’s first marriage.
