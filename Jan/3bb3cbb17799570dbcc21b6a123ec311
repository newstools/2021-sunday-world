Johannesburg – The burden of “black tax” causes financial distress to middle- class professionals because they usually have no savings left after having to share their salaries with entire families. However, there are ways to help your family without going broke. Kenosi Magosha, head: savings client solutions at Sanlam, explains that while the concept creates a positive initiative to uplift future generations’ socio- economic status, it can become a vicious cycle if not managed properly. “The long-term goal of giving money in the form of ‘black tax’ should be to enable your family members to become financially independent, for example, paying for education or vocational training, creating a domino effect for future generations. Notably, when it comes to supporting parents and other extended family members it’s about sustainability as well because opportunities for creating financial independence may be limited. “The tough times we live in make it quite challenging to gain the balance because there has been more of a focus on survival. Magosha says that we need to focus on principles that can help with managing where we are but, also sow seeds for future advancements. ‘‘It will require discipline,” she explains. She highlights six considerations to help you and your family balance your finances and financial obligations: Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
