Johannesburg – The tragic passing of Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu has seen a few among us show the worst in humanity: the lack of empathy and Ubuntu. The moegoes of this week are the despicable hoodlums who “jokingly” said on social media that they would have traded the life of Mthembu with that of his cabinet colleague Bheki Cele. This is not only disgusting but points to moral decay in our society. Every human life matters and wishing death on anyone is despicable and says a lot about us as a society. The cowards who hide behind 140 characters are a shame to the society we are trying to build. For all their efforts, the scoundrels who wished death upon their fellow human beings need to be shunned by society. Bloody moegoes. Charmza Who is Amanda Gorman? That was the question on many lips around the world on Wednesday as the young poet captivated the globe during US President Joe Biden’s inauguration. The confidence and talent she displayed is the stuff of legends. It is no surprise that the likes of Oprah Winfrey have already dubbed her the next Maya Angelou. Her powerful presence on that stage made many young black girls across the world believe that anything is possible in a free and caring world.
